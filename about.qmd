# About Me

Hi, I' m **Ning**, an aspiring data analyst.

My current focus is **statistics**, **R-based data analysis** and **corporate-related political risk issues**.

My background is in **Accountancy**. If you have any doubts about corporate auditing issues, maybe i can help you.

I really hate graphical interface data analysis software, because it always gives me extra results that I didn't ask for.

My current short-term goal is to publish my first **peer-reviewed paper** and start my **PhD** by 2023.

In my free time, I like listening to **music**, **hiking** and **reading**. If you also like these activities, please feel free to contact me.
