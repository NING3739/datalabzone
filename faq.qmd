## Are there any other software or resources you recommend for data science? {#sec-are-there-any-other-software-or-resources-you-recommend-for-data-science}

As a science researcher, I deal with various scientific tools every day. Here, I have listed some of the software I use. If anyone knows better software, please leave a comment in the section below.

### Statistical software

Statistical software is the most commonly used, and I mainly focus on R language, for no other reason than it being free and powerful!!!

-   [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (free and open source)

-   [Rstudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) (the most popular R IDE)

-   [IBM SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/spss)

-   [OriginLab](https://www.originlab.com/)

-   [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/)

### Reference management software

Good reference management software will greatly improve your efficiency in selecting and citing literature.

-   [Endnote](https://endnote.com/)

-   [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)

-   [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/)

### Flowchart software
